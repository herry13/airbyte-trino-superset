# Data Analytics Platform using Airbyte+S3+Trino+Superset

This is an example of Data Analytics Platform using ...

- [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com) -- for extracting data from your data sources
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) -- a cost effective storage of your data
- [Trino](https://trino.io) -- a scalable engine to query your data
- [Superset](https://superset.apache.org) -- for visualising your data to provide actionable insight

All of the above components are free (open source) except AWS S3.
You can replace AWS S3 with [Googe Object Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage),
[Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/storage/blobs),
or [MinIO](https://min.io). The latter is more suitable for on-premise deployment.
